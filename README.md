# Pima Indians Diabetes Classification

## Overview

This project involves building a neural network model to predict the presence of diabetes in patients using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The model is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend and is designed to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical diagnostic features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv). It contains 8 features related to medical measurements and a binary target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- keras
- tensorflow

You can install the required packages using `pip`. Below is a list of the main packages and their versions:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy keras tensorflow
```

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the model**:

    Execute the `diabetes_model.py` script to train and evaluate the model:

    ```bash
    python diabetes_model.py
    ```

## Code Explanation

- **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using pandas from a CSV file hosted online.
- **Model Definition**: A Sequential neural network model is defined with three hidden layers and one output layer.
- **Compilation**: The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the dataset with specified epochs and batch size.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated, and predictions are made.
- **Summary**: The results of the model's predictions are compared to the actual labels.

## Example

Here is a brief example of how to use the model:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
dataset = pd.read_csv(url, delimiter=',')
array = dataset.values
X = array[:, 0:8]
y = array[:, 8]

# Define model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(4, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, batch_size=10)

# Evaluate model
_, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y)
print('Accuracy: %.2f' % (accuracy * 100))

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
rounded = [round(x[0]) for x in predictions]
for i in range(5):
    print('%s => %d (expected %d)' % (X[i].tolist(), rounded[i], y[i]))
```

## Potential Applications

This diabetes classification model can be useful in various types of projects and applications, including:

1. **Healthcare Analytics**: To predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical data, enabling early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
2. **Medical Research**: To study patterns and factors contributing to diabetes and test the effectiveness of interventions.
3. **Patient Monitoring**: To assist in monitoring patients' health status and managing diabetes-related risk factors.
4. **Health Informatics**: To integrate with electronic health record systems to provide predictive insights and support decision-making.
